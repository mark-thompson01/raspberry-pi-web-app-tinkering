# raspberry-pi-web-app-tinkering

Through this project, I aim to showcase my understanding of reconnaissance techniques, vulnerability scanning tools, and analysis processes. The lab uses a custom-built web application hosted on a Raspberry Pi running Apache, configured with Webdav for uploading files to. This application is designed to simulate real-world vulnerabilities, making it an excellent learning tool for web application security.

## Lab Setup
The lab environment consists of two interconnected VMs:

> **Kali Linux VM:** Platform utilized to apply various offensive security tools on Raspberry Pi target.
> **Raspberry Pi 3:** Dummy web server configured with WebDAV implementation for demonstration purposes.

## 🔁 How to Recreate This Lab
- Download and install Oracle VirtualBox.
- Download, install, and setup a Kali Linux VM.
- Setup network connected Raspberry Pi 3.
- Configure Apache Web Server with purposely vulnerable WebDAV configuration.
- Perform vulnerability scanning with nmap and nikto.
- Run multiple nmap commands in a single bash script.
- Perform directory busting with dirb, dirbuster, gobuster.
- Analyze web application behavior via http methods with Burp Suite.
