# raspberry-pi-web-app-tinkering

Through this project, I aim to showcase my understanding of reconnaissance techniques, vulnerability scanning tools, and analysis processes. The lab uses a custom-built web application hosted on a Raspberry Pi running Apache, configured with Webdav for uploading files to. This application is designed to simulate real-world vulnerabilities, making it an excellent learning tool for web application security.
